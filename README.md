# Raster_calcs
This started out as examples of working with Geotiff files, but became the defacto location for processing the Sandwich mapping results.
Basically, there are three types of files here:
* Scripts to process Sandwich raster data...many of which lead to useful final-ish products.
* Scripts to process other Sandwich data...again, many of which are useful analyses.
* Tests or examples where I figure out / remind myself of how to do something.
Below, I briefly list filenames with brief notes to remind me of what they do, and where they stand.
